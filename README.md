# Cov

Cov is a simple code coverage checker for golang. It's like codacy or codecov
(at least regarding features that people actually want), but not SaaS in a few
line of code. It can be used in a integration pipeline to validate pull request
coverage.

## Installation

    go install github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/cov@latest

Or you can get a release from the releases page.

## Usage

    Analyzes coverage

    Usage:
      cov cover.out... [flags]

    Flags:
      -b, --branch string    The branch to use to check the patch coverage against. Example: master
      -f, --filter strings   The filters to use for coverage lookup
      -h, --help             help for cov
      -i, --ignore strings   Define patterns to ignore matching files.
      -q, --quiet            Do not print details, just the verdict
      -t, --threshold int    The target of coverage in percent that is requested

When the `--branch BASE` is used a diff will be done between your current branch
and the branch passed as base to identify the files you changed.

You can pass several coverage files, they all will be merged.

You can filter for a given package or any substring.

When `--threshold X` is set, the output will be colored given that target and the return will be 1 if target is not reached.

You can ignore files matching some patterns using the `--ignore` option:


## Examples

Show coverage for all coverage files:

    cov *.out

Show coverage for a pull request against master:

    cov --branch master coverage.out

Ignore all files in `autogen/api` and `examples`:

    cov --ignore "**/autogen/api/*" --ignore "**/examples/*" coverage.out

> Note: Your pull branch **must** be aligned with latest change of the base branch


## Github Action

You can use this repository as a Github Action for your workflows. You simply
need to make sure one of your step generates a coverage file (usually using `go
test -coverprofile=coverage.out`) then add a new step:

```yaml
    name: build-go
    on:
      push:
        branches:
        - master
      pull_request:
    jobs:
      build:
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - uses: actions/setup-go@v3
        - name: test
          run: go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
        - uses: PaloAltoNetworks/cov@master
          with:
            cov_version: latest
            cov_file: coverage.out
            cov_threshold: "70"
            main: master
```
